# Shrimps-and-Prawns

I want to do a fun webpage before I jump studying Javascript and I thought hololive would be a good reference.
It is still incomplete and I'll try to finish it at some other time but rn I'm having a bit burnout due to tons of tutorials I watched and time I spent to make this webpage. And I still need to study JavaScript!! 

Language I used: HTML CSS and a teensy bit of Javascript that I watched from tutorials.

The other javascript, scroll-out, which triggers CSS animation on scroll comes from this link:
